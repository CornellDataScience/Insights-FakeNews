# Insights-FakeNews

<i>James Chen, Max Chen, Shalin Mehta, Brandon Truong, Danny Yang</i>

People will <i>never</i> stop talking about the 2016 election. While we will never know the actual extent of the effect of fake news, the least we can do is try to classify articles as fake news or real, with the hope of stopping the spread of misinformation.

This project involves building NLP models for stance and relevance classification and building a visual product providing insights into classification of Fake News.

We are approaching the problem as defined by the Fake News Challenge (FNC-1): http://www.fakenewschallenge.org/
Broadly speaking, this is split into two tasks - a relevance detection task and a stance detection task
