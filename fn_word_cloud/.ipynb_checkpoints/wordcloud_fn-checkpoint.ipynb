slowly jumped air right moment zero g day exact hoax resurfaced week couple places decided update debunking include new links repost hopefully stem tide silliness year end seems fitting hopefully also last debunking make knows still week left something never hear say well heard long experience taught always sillier claim always hearing guy debunked ideas maya calendar predicted end world supermoon caused earthquakes magnetic pole flip earth cause superstorms another saying earth already physically starting flip sillier well claim early next year jan pst exact due combined gravity jupiter pluto able jump air float couple seconds least fall slowly depending different sources hard overstate wrong claim first exact hoax pulled last year site called news hound offline apparently lot people fell year later back spot time joke made news site called daily buzz live even bother change much wording original hoax even picture nasa tweet event one problem picture completely fake nasa never tweeted presumably made wholesale article daily buzz live whoever clever adding number retweets favorites fake iphone buy street new york city physics zero g day wrong claim pluto jupiter wrong part real killer based joke made astronomer nearly years ago despite spreading around facebook twitter much got lot people asking telling debunking thing get started claim revealed british astronomer patrick moore morning january th extraordinary astronomical event occur exactly planet pluto pass directly behind jupiter relation earth rare alignment mean combined gravitational force two planets would exert stronger tidal pull temporarily counteracting earth gravity making people weigh less moore calls jovian plutonian gravitational effect yeah except baloney polite ok wrong pluto jupiter sitting tree first gravitational forces planets solar system essentially zero effect personally done full stop ok fine give brief details planets big objects lots gravity affects close space however big call space planets far away weakens gravity hugely reducing less impact flutter butterfly wing want math go even add planets together pull force less percent moon daily buzz live article mentions tides even worse combined tidal force planets far less like percent moon simply put planets far away real effect way moon orbits earth ellipse gravity fluctuates far combined strength planets every two weeks note cannot float air every two weeks specifically gravity pluto weakest pluto teeny tiny ice ball far smaller even moon closest flippin billion kilometers billion miles earth long way car road half kilometer away gravitational pull pluto fact math find earth pulls trillion times harder pluto ratio number cells body single cell claim float like saying shed single cell fly away flapping arms location gets worse amazingly article says pluto directly behind jupiter jan checked day nearly opposite sides sky really far apart picked much worse date claim pluto behind jupiter physics claim ridiculous origin claims makes even funnier fool shame article daily buzz live mentions claim came patrick moore real astronomer u k enormously popular radio television science program presenter predated carl sagan still considered icon science england wonderful thing moore actually make claim however snopes com points april fools day joke moore made claim radio program complete unsurprise apparently folks called say feel effect called priming tell people advance feel something due cause even cause never happened used ghost hunters ghost tour guides quite bit spook people actually enter haunted house guaranteeing feel chills walk room room seen first hand people convince amazing things never actually happened hope floats go repeat silly claim based joke first place know lot people reading right slapping foreheads wondering people stupid fall understand reaction share smart people fall silly things time intelligence really prime factor skepticism general schools teach people analyze claim tell something makes sense surface go looking claim knew right away math see pluto jupiter really aligned article says often people think carefully claims simply spread social media takes literally click share button pseudoscience thrives via virulence whereas truth must take harder path fact bother debunking stuff like sure silly claim probably harmless practice already mentioned mayan notpocalypse tick dozen doomsday scary claims spread due lack skepticism course real issues like global warming denial anti vaccination live breathe spread due lack skepticism public original post january said particular bit fluff dry float away day two others stay long time wrong known something like would resurface year like mars big moon nonsense comes back year year still hope
